# Flight Price Prediction & Analysis

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive flight price prediction and analysis system that involves data collection, processing, visualization, and machine learning modeling. We analyze flight pricing trends and predict future prices using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Scraped flight prices from Skyscanner API, Google Flights API, and web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup, Selenium).
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and transformed data using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost for price prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score for evaluation.
- **Web Dashboard**: Built an interactive dashboard using HTML, JavaScript, and Chart.js.
- **Deployment**: Optional deployment with Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.

## Technologies Used
1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost
3. **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees
4. **Data Processing & Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
5. **Feature Engineering**: One-Hot Encoding, StandardScaler, Label Encoding (from Scikit-learn)
6. **Data Collection & APIs**: BeautifulSoup, Selenium (for web scraping), Skyscanner API, Google Flights API
7. **Model Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score, Cross-Validation
8. **Deployment (Optional)**: Flask, FastAPI (for creating a web app), Streamlit (for visualization)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-price-prediction.git

   ```


## Data Analysis in Google Colab
We performed in-depth analysis using Google Colab, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Price trend visualization
